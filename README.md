# logutil

This is just a small personal practice project.

The goal is to create a simple logging utility that can be easily added to any CMake-based C++ project.  
It's meant to replace the usual `std::cout << ...` calls with something like:

```cpp
LOG_INFO  << "some message";
LOG_WARN  << "warn message";
LOG_ERROR << "error message";
```

And the output will automatically include useful context like `__FILE__`, `__LINE__`, and the function signature (depending on compiler, e.g. `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__` or `__FUNCSIG__`).

---

## How to Use

1. Drop this folder into your project, e.g., `external/logutil/`
2. In your `CMakeLists.txt`, add:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(external/logutil)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE logutil)
```

3. Then use it in your code:

```cpp
#include "logutil/logstream.hpp"

void foo() {
    LOG_INFO << "Hello";
}
```

## CMake Options

This utility supports a few options that can be configured via `-D` flags when running `cmake`:

| Option                    | Default | Description                                |
|--------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| `LOGUTIL_USE_STRUCTURED_LOGGING` | `ON`    | Enables structured log output              |
| `LOGUTIL_INCLUDE_FILE`   | `ON`    | Includes file path                         |
| `LOGUTIL_INCLUDE_LINE`   | `ON`    | Includes line number                       |
| `LOGUTIL_INCLUDE_FUNC`   | `ON`    | Includes function signature                |
| `LOGUTIL_SHORTEN_PATH`   | `ON`    | Shortens file path with `...`              |
| `LOGUTIL_PATH_DEPTH`     | `5`     | Number of path segments to keep when shortening |

### Example:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DLOGUTIL_USE_STRUCTURED_LOGGING=ON \
  -DLOGUTIL_INCLUDE_FUNC=ON \
  -DLOGUTIL_SHORTEN_PATH=ON \
  -DLOGUTIL_PATH_DEPTH=3
```

## ðŸ”§ Customizing Log Level Prefixes

By default, log levels are shown as `[INFO]`, `[WARN]`, and `[ERROR]`.  
You can override the labels by defining the following macros when linking `logutil`:

```cmake
target_compile_definitions(myapp PRIVATE
    LOG_PREFIX_INFO=I
    LOG_PREFIX_WARN=W
    LOG_PREFIX_ERROR=E
)
```

This will change the output to look like:

```
[I]   src/.../main.cpp : 10 in foo - message
[W]   src/.../main.cpp : 11 in foo - warning
[E]   src/.../main.cpp : 12 in foo - error
```

You can use any string or symbol as the prefix.  
This is useful for customizing the log format or aligning with existing logging systems.

## Notes

- This is a small experiment and not meant for production use.
- Mainly written for learning purposes â€” feel free to modify as needed.

## Planned Features / TODO

- [ ] Add `LOG_DEBUG` level and support log level filtering
- [ ] Include timestamp in each log line
- [ ] Show current thread ID in structured logs
